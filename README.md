# Pneumonia_Detection
Chest X-Rays are used to detect Pneumonia in patients. We have built an artificial intelligence system
that is capable of identifying the infection through patient's X-ray reports.
The study evaluates hoe a deep-learning algorithm can detect pneumonia in chest X-rays in emergency dept. 
using Convolutional Neural Networks.
